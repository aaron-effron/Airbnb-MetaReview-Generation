1,1,5/21/13,1,A,"Here is the best  I ate organic and fresh meat , nice atmosphere, really friendly service ... music great , clean restroom.. I FORGOT TO SAY MEAT IS HALAL"
1,1,5/21/13,2,A,"Came here for a weekday lunch with a friend. I had the chicken pita while my friend had the vegetarian zucchini fritter pita. The chicken was pretty good--thought the orange in it was an interesting addition! It started to fall apart as I was eating it, and I resorted to just eating it with a fork. My friend let me try hers, and I liked the zucchini fritters a lot. If I come back, I might order that one next time...While the rice plates looked really good on the menu, I resorted to getting a pita due to the price. I think the food is pretty good but it would be *really* good if these were priced maybe $2 less a piece. Maybe they could offer a lunch combo price or just another cheaper option.  The owner of the place was very friendly and checked in on our meal a few times."
1,1,5/21/13,3,A,"4.5 stars!  An amazing restaurant serving pita sandwiches, salads, and rice plates with vibrant Greek flavors, Kali is a great place for a quick, healthy meal. On my visit, I tried the lamb salad, which came with chunks of flavorful leg of lamb, cucumber, tomato, mint, greens (lettuce/kale), feta, and a bright lemon-oregano vinaigrette. Every bite of the salad was packed with flavor and a fresh crunch! I also tried the chicken salad, which was every bit as good, as well as the zucchini fritters, which were surprisingly soft on the inside with tons of fresh shreds of cooked zucchini. On top of the great food, the service was also incredibly friendly, and though the prices may seem a bit high for the portion sizes, you're paying for the great quality of the organic, local ingredients."
1,1,5/21/13,4,A,"I stopped in at Kali for a weekday lunch and it looks like this new place is already popular. California Avenue needs more fast casual restaurants in my opinion, so I'm glad this is here! It helps that the food is good too! The menu is pretty simple - you can either order a pita, a salad, or a rice plate and choose what type of meat/veg option you want. I went with the vegetarian pita, which I thought was really good. The vegetarian option here is zucchini fritters, which is something you don't see often, so it was a welcome change. True to its name, it seems like Kali is serving Greek food, but with a modern California twist. Instead of basic lettuce, my pita came with a mix of fresh greens, and also included shredded carrots, mint leaves and radishes. I think the salad mix really made a huge difference - it tasted great! The pita itself was good too and the portion size was just right. I saw a few other people had ordered salads and they looked huge! I really liked the decor of Kali, and you could tell they thought through the details of every element, down to the plates. Lots of blue like one would expect in a Greek restaurant, but very sleek and not kitschy at all. I'll happily pop in here again for lunch or dinner in the future."
1,1,5/21/13,5,A,"2.5-3 stars. I ordered a lamb pita and my friend ordered the beef pita and both came out incredibly dry (the meats). It was a shame because it tasted great but it was burnt. My pita was modernized - tons of vinaigrette in it that made it difficult to eat because it was too tart and messy because the pita was drenched. Gavin's side of rice was under-seasoned albeit very fluffy. Service was off and on. The gentleman was very nice and welcoming, even checked on us after our meal came out but the chick that ran the food and tried to clear our table did not seem engaging or friendly. Not sure if she understood English but we asked her for a to-go box and she looked at us puzzled. We told her she can take that lemonade-mint drink thing and she left it there. At least we had a great time talking and sharing. I cannot wait to see her again and have a cook-off at some point. I love having friends that love food and love to cook and bake."
2,2,5/21/13,1,A,"I visited Poki Bowl when I was in San Jose for a work trip - I literally, 1,000%, want to franchise one here in KCMO. I go to bed dreaming about this place... It's a real struggle. Hands down, the best quick eat I've had in a good year or two."
2,2,5/21/13,2,A,"Good, fresh raw fish bar. It isn't my favorite as compared to other-like places but I think it's great on its own. I wouldn't recommend the rice options - brown rice was almost crispy and the white rice was soooooo soft and mushy. I wish they had a noodle option like other places. Service was ok. I do like that they have the macaron ice cream sandwiches. Cookies & cream was my favorite. Is it worth $4.95 though? I'm not sure..."
2,2,5/21/13,3,A,"What happened? Seems like quality went down over the past few months. Not only do the staff at this location seem to lack energy but they appear to not care about the customers. The past few times (before I completely stopped going) they seemed to be rude and just want to push out customers after a purchase. I use to go to Pokibowl often (this was the first location I went to) but after getting food poisoning back in early October, I've thought twice about going to this establishment again. Not to mention, they seemed to have jacked the price up. $14, are you kidding me? Sorry but you've lost a customer. There's other good poke places out in the South Bay with quality food, prices and staff"
2,2,5/21/13,4,A,"Compared to other poke bowl houses I gave this 3 stars. The rice was clumpy and soft and hard. It didn't appear to be fully cooked. In fact when I saw them open the rice pot and scoop out my white rice  it looked liked the pot was too full. It was also a little wet. Why so much emphasis on rice? Well the rice is the foundation of the bowl. It absorbs all the juices and orchestrates the flavor of the bowl. And it's why Poki Bowl even calls it the foundation. Step 2 the fish. The fish was ok. You can't really tell because the bowl is flavored with other sauces. But I could feel the texture of the fish with my  tongue. And it felt la little tough. Step 3 sauces. The sauces were ok. Nothing too special they offered sirachi sauce (which I love) but compared to other poki houses, those other houses make their own bowls. Step 4 toppings. They put a lot of toppings. Step 4.5 they offered more sauce. I didn't know if this was part of it? Should I should I not? Ok more sauce. Overall it was good but compared to other houses this was a 3. It was a lot of food. I spent $17 because I ordered the regular, added an extra topping of sea weed, and got a Calpico drink. This is what was left of my bowl... see picture."
2,2,5/21/13,5,A,"Pretty amazing stuff! The fish is super fresh. The toppings were awesome, they have some fun and awesome toppings, it was phenomenal. I recommend this place for sure. Be prepared for an explosion in your mouth. Try the Spicy sauce, and then sesame and both sauce is at the end. You're welcome! My favorite will always be the salmon, with avocado, the crab meat, and the ginger! Bomb! It's like a chipotle for sushi, but much better! Must try! and let me know what you think!"
3,3,5/21/13,1,A,"The cozy, decorated atmosphere of this Turkish restaurant and bar is a great setting for a nice meal and drink. Coming for dinner on a weeknight, we were seated at one of the many tables, and the servers were so hospitable in recommending dishes and serving us. We started with the combo appetizer plate, which came with hummus, tabbouleh, dolma, falafel, piyas (white beans), and babaghanoush, all of which paired nicely with the basket of pita/bread! The babaghanoush was definitely my favorite item on the plate--the eggplant had such a smoky flavor and aroma, but everything else was a little underwhelming in terms of flavor, and the size of the platter was absolutely tiny for the high price. We continued with the combo grill for our entree, which came with a skewer of chicken, a skewer of lamb, kofte kebab, and slices of doner kebab too, along with a yogurt dipping sauce, rice, and steamed vegetables. Everything on here was good (I especially liked the tender lamb cubes), though again, I thought the flavors of the dish could have been bolder. My favorite dish of the evening was definitely the moussaka, a casserole of eggplant, potato, ground beef/lamb, and bechamel sauce--everything from the crispiness of the potatoes to the savory tomato sauce was just perfect, and it went so well with the rice on the side too! To finish, we had the kunefe, a dessert of baked cheese topped with phyllo noodles and drizzled with a housemade syrup. I found the dessert to be a little underwhelming--this kunefe seemed to lack a certain fragrance and complexity that I've tasted elsewhere, and I probably wouldn't order it again. Overall, not a bad place for a night out, but I wasn't particularly impressed by the value or the flavors of many of the dishes. However, there were definitely a few other items on the menu that would've been nice to try out!"
3,3,5/21/13,2,A,"A new co-worker and I checked out Anatolian's on our first trip out to Palo Alto.  I staked my yelp rep on Anatolian's delivering and was fairly happy with the results! We arrived on a quite Monday with reservations via Open Table.  We were greeted and quickly seated. Without missing a beat, the restaurant staff offered us water (checking for tap vs sparkling first), provided us menus, and set up our evening.  That may seem odd to mention, but it was rather smooth and started the night well. We both got drinks, I went with the New York Sour if I recall the name correctly, and decided to spill an app.  While I wouldn't say the menu was overly extensive, we did take our time reviewing options. The Falafel Plate was a good sized app for two people.  It came with a small  salad and some delish hummus as well.  I happened to have some Falafel late the week before which allowed me to compare and say Anatolian's version was pretty good.  They weren't overly dry and had a good mixture of favors. For my main, I opted to go with the Sultan's Favorite (HUNKAR BEGENDI).  Warning: the dish comes out extremely hot, so be ready to give it a minute or two before digging in (plenty of time for a nice photo!).  For those not familiar, Hunkar Begendi is roasted eggplant with mozzarella cheese and  nut meg topped with braised tenderloin.  I was happy with the portion and the ratio of tenderloin to the remainder of the dish.  I didn't quite finish it all, but would highly recommend it. We closed with Baklava, because why not.  I told my co-worker it was probably going to be heavy but hey we both walked here so we earned it.  It ended up being anything but... very light, extremely tasty and another clear recommendation (which is probably why they list as RECOMMENDED on the menu). Net, check'em out.  You'll enjoy.  I'll probably be back on a future Palo Alto trip."
3,3,5/21/13,3,A,"Phenomenal service but the food was decent. I speak from my own rating system of falafels and they unfortunately fell short. Not bad but nothing great. When I travel to the Bay area, I know my taste buds are going to hit the ceiling so this place was a bit disappointing. The cezve was pretty darn amazing - smooth and delicious and HOT!!"
3,3,5/21/13,4,A,"I really enjoyed my dinner at this casual Turkish restaurant.  Met my friend here; we both had some wine and started by splitting the ezme.  They brought out a bowl of breads, the ezme and a really delicious garlicky olive oil dip as well.  I had a lamb dish (can't remember the name) and my friend had Aleksandr's favorite.  We finished with the baklava, which was flaky and perfect, and once again, the portion was big. Portions are enormous, wine pours are generous, everything tastes delicious, and service is friendly and fast. Really all you can want from a restaurant."
3,3,5/21/13,5,A,"Had a friend recommend Anatolian Kitchen a couple years and we keep going back for their amazing rice!! It's a blend of spices, white rice with vegetables mixed in and it's delicious. I usually order their chicken shish kebab plate which is always good! Their appetizers are great too! Definitely a great pic if you're looking for a place to eat on California Ave. in Palo Alto."
4,4,5/21/13,1,A,"I love the people here and the wine here. They provide complimentary bread and olive oil/balsamic vinegar with your glass of wine. The only thing I would say beware of is where is you sit, because there can be a lot of bugs flying towards you if you sit in the wrong spot."
4,4,5/21/13,2,A,"First off I will give Caffe Riace some positive from this negative experience: the venue is gorgeous and filled with unique artwork. The weather was nice and we were comfortable sitting outside, I almost wish we had gone a little later to see the lights that were strung in the trees. Now a few things went wrong while we had our date night. I made reservations earlier that day and when we showed up they had no record of the reservation, but did let us chose wherever we wanted to sit (not that big of a deal). We sat down, greeted normally by our server, but when we ordered wine my top 2 choices were sold out (personally, I wish they would have let us know when we were greeted). We had at least 3 different servers work with us throughout the 1.5 hours we were there. At the end of the meal we were given the wrong check. My boyfriend is a stand up guy and quickly flagged the guy down and let him know. I'd like to say others would do that same but the check we received was at least $70 less than our actual check. That server would have definitely been in trouble if the restaurant missed out on $70, perhaps pay closer attention to the tables. Here's the kicker: the food was great and I absolutely loved everything we got...until 1AM. I got viscous food poisoning! I got the Ravioli al Granchio, so beware."
4,4,5/21/13,3,A,"Their gnocchi is still really good, but prices are really high for pasta. Also, I am really pissed that they charged me for 2 sodas when I had a refill of fountain soda! Absurd!"
4,4,5/21/13,4,A,"I came here for an event and brought a nice Nikon DSLR camera which I forgot on my table. As soon as I got home (about 15 minutes later), I called to see if it was still on the table or if any of the staff had collected it. They said there was no camera! I drove back to check anyway and nada. I knew everyone at the event and no one would have stolen it. My guess is one of the staff did, or another patron (although less likely and why didn't the staff collect it immediately when they were bussing to prevent that?). Really shocking, especially in Palo Alto. The food is below average for the price anyway. Stay away!"
4,4,5/21/13,5,A,"I tried making a reservation for a large party here and thought I had secured a table for a party of 12 on the patio. I call back a week before my reservation to confirm the details and they did not have my reservation on the books, and told me I had to sign an agreement which I was never informed of when I made the initial reservation. I suggested reiterating to their team how to handle large events, and was told not to tell them how to run their team. I will never book anything at this establishment."
5,5,5/21/13,1,A,"We had lunch here today... Food was really good. I ordered the Beef Rice Bowl - so flavorful and so good! My husband ordered a Hummus Bowl with Lamb which he loved. The pita were served fresh and we had a choice of either white or whole wheat. We did half and half... Both were good but the white pita is the best with hummus. The lady who helped us was great. She gave us pointers on which ones to try as first timers here. We ended up buying hummus to go. Small hummus comes with 1 pita and if you would like to order more pitas, they are $0.85 each. Large side of hummus comes with 2 pitas. Would definitely come back!"
5,5,5/21/13,2,A,"Loved this place. Their hummus bowls are fantastic, but can be a bit much if your not used to eating a full meals worth of hummus in one go. Hummus bowl with mushrooms + side of their fantastic falafels + a side of beets. Don't forget to eat as many of the pita breads as you can, they are the best I have ever had."
5,5,5/21/13,3,A,"This place has one of the best hummus I've ever tasted. So smooth and fresh. Each type of hummus comes with its own flavors and tastes. Their pita bread is freshly baked and fluffy. Comes out hot with the hummus. I also love to get their sweet potato fries. These are also the best sweet potato fries ever. They are thick cut so when you bite into it you can also taste the softness of the actual sweet potato. Comes out super hot so be careful! It also has a dipping sauce that pairs really well. Next is the Fatush salad. This is amazing! The flavors of all the vegetables really come together with the feta cheese. A small cup of garlic sauce on the side to enhance all the flavors but you don't really need it. Mixed with some fried pita bread which gives it texture and crunch. Lastly is the bowl of rice. This dish comes with choice of chicken, beef, falafel, or vegetable skewers. I chose falafel and it was wonderful. I can't wait to come back and try the other choices. The rice has seasoning mixed with tomatoes. Love this dish! As for the customer service here, they did a wonderful job. Always keeping our water cups full and checking up on us. Just a tip that they do get busy during lunch and dinner time and since this is a smaller place there will be a wait."
5,5,5/21/13,4,A,"Grabbing lunch with some friends while visiting the Bay, they suggested we meet up at Oren's Hummus Shop. I usually try to avoid University Avenue, especially on the weekends because parking can be a nightmare. Luckily, I found a 2 hour parking spot down a side street a few blocks away. Anyways, when we arrived the place was packed - it isn't a very large space and I would not recommend it for a party larger than 4 people. They were busy with to-go and take-out orders as well - so just something to keep in mind. We put our name in for a table for 4 and we were seated about 20 minutes later. We decided to share their appetizer that gave us a little sample of all the ""favorites"". And for my entree I chose a chicken kabob with a side of veggies (because a veggie kabob just comes with veggies and a chicken kabob just comes with chicken... ok.) For my sides, I chose the falafel balls and one of the roasted eggplants. Everything I ate was scrumptious. The food is amazing and you can really tell that they take the time to serve up quality items and use the best ingredients."
5,5,5/21/13,5,A,"Long wait but excellent food! I love that they're partnered with Yelp that I was able to make a reservation in line while we were down the block looking for parking. It really helped cut down on the wait time. It's a small and cozy restaurant that if you come in a small party, you'll most likely be sharing a table with other people. It wasn't an issue with is at all. Our neighbors actually offered us some extra pita bread. The staff is really friendly and they work hard! They're constantly running around but they take their time with you when you're ordering. And even if they're busy, they still notice if you need something and stopped by periodically to check on us. Our waiter was really knowledgeable about the menu.On order was the lamb hummus, sweet potato fries, and Oren's eggplant. All were delicious! The complementary salad was really good as well. Their dressing with the cabbage was really close to the taste of Asian pickled radish, which I love. The lamb on the hummus was braised really well and was so tender. It wasn't very gamey tasting either. The sweet potato fries were like any average sweet potato fries but the dipping sauce that came with it really changes the flavor. Oren's eggplant was very garlicky flavor and served cold, which caught me off guard. Still delicious though. Beware of the green sauce on the side! It's extremely spicy and made with Serrano peppers. The red sauce, which went very well with the hummus, was more savory and tomatoey with some spice. I had a great experience here and I think this restaurant has become a place that I'll be craving to come back to."
